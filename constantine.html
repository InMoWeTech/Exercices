            <h1>Absrtract</h1>
            <p>Constantine I, also known as <strong>Constantine the Great</strong>, was a <em>Roman emperor</em> from AD 306 to 337 and the first Roman
                emperor to convert to Christianity. He played a pivotal role in elevating the status of Christianity in Rome,
                decriminalizing Christian practice and ceasing Christian persecution in a period referred to as the Constantinian
                shift. Constantine is also the originator of the religiopolitical ideology known as Constantinism, which epitomizes
                the unity of church and state, as opposed to separation of church and state.</p>
            <h1>Sources</h1>
            <p>Constantine was a ruler of major importance and has always been a controversial figure. The fluctuations in his
                reputation reflect the nature of the ancient sources for his reign. These are abundant and detailed, but they have
                been strongly influenced by the official propaganda of the period and are often one-sided; no contemporaneous
                histories or biographies dealing with his life and rule have survived. The nearest replacement is Eusebius's
                Vita Constantini — a mixture of eulogy and hagiography written between 335 and circa 339 — that extols Constantine's
                moral and religious virtues. The Vita creates a contentiously positive image of Constantine, and modern historians
                have frequently challenged its reliability. The fullest secular life of Constantine is the anonymous Origo Constantini,
                a work of uncertain date which focuses on military and political events to the neglect of cultural and religious matters.</p>
            <p>Constantine was born in Naissus (today Niš, Serbia), part of the Dardania province of Moesia on 27 February,
                c. AD 272. His father was Flavius Constantius[j] an Illyrian who was born in the same region (then called Dacia
                Ripensis) and a native of the province of Moesia. His original full name, as well as that of his father, is not
                known. His praenomen is variously given as Lucius, Marcus and Gaius. Whatever the case, praenomina had already
                disappeared from most public records by this time. He also adopted the name "Valerius", the nomen of emperor
                Diocletian, following his father's ascension as caesar.</p>
